# 👋 Hey, I'm JoãoRicardoFP  
Full-stack developer • Tech explorer • UI/UX enthusiast

I'm a Brazilian developer passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences through clean interfaces, elegant systems, and modern engineering.  
I build things that are **fast**, **minimal**, and **intentional** — always balancing design, functionality, and technical depth.

Right now, I'm on a journey shaped by:

- **Full-stack development** (TypeScript, Next.js, Node, GraphQL)  
- **Design & UI/UX** (clean, minimal, modern)  
- **Systems architecture** (APIs, real-time apps, performance-focused stacks)  

My work spans creativity, development, and technical exploration.
